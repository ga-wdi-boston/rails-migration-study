## Explain the Role of Migrations

In your own words, define migrations and explain why developers use them.

```md
Migrations are used to create databases and to update the last version in the history to the newest version. They allow you do do this without writing sql.
```

## Reference Documentation for Migrations

In ActiveRecord Migrations, what is the name of the method the creates a new
table?

```md
create_table
```

What is the name of the method that creates a new column?

```md
add_column
```

Suppose that an application needs a table called `pets` with the columns `name`
and `breed`, both of which are strings. `name` cannot be blank and must be
unique. Write the migration would be used to create a table satisfying these
requirements.

```ruby
class CreatePets < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
  def change
    create_table :pets do |t|
      t.string :name, null: false, unique: true
      t.string :breed
    end
  end
end
```

## Explain the Role of Seed Data

In your own words, explain the role of application seed data.

```md
seed data is the initial data that gets added to a database.
```

Should seed data be used for experimentation during development?

```md
yes, it allows devs to test their code.
```
