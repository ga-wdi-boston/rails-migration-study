## Explain the Role of Migrations

In your own words, define migrations and explain why developers use them.

```md
It looks like migrations are a way to mutate and store tables over a period of time, meaning you wont have to write SQL for each mutation and will have an active and comprehensive record of the mutations made to the table, with the ability to revert should a damaging change be made.
```

## Reference Documentation for Migrations

In ActiveRecord Migrations, what is the name of the method the creates a new
table?

```md
create_table
```

What is the name of the method that creates a new column?

```md
add_column
```

Suppose that an application needs a table called `pets` with the columns `name`
and `breed`, both of which are strings. `name` cannot be blank and must be
unique. Write the migration would be used to create a table satisfying these
requirements.

```ruby
class CreatePets < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
  def change
    create_table :pets do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.string :breed
  end
end
```

## Explain the Role of Seed Data

In your own words, explain the role of application seed data.

```md
Seed data is necessary for an application to run. Seeds seem to streamline the process of adding and mutating data within the table.
```

Should seed data be used for experimentation during development?

```md
No. It is vital to the application running and shouldnt be touched without a good idea what you're doing.
```
