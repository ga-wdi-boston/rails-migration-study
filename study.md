## Explain the Role of Migrations

In your own words, define migrations and explain why developers use them.

```md
Migrations are a feature of Active Record that allows for the creation and updating of database tables using generic ruby code rather than SQL, which can vary between databases.
```

## Reference Documentation for Migrations

In ActiveRecord Migrations, what is the name of the method the creates a new
table?

```md
create_table
```

What is the name of the method that creates a new column?

```md
add_column
```

Suppose that an application needs a table called `pets` with the columns `name`
and `breed`, both of which are strings. `name` cannot be blank and must be
unique. Write the migration would be used to create a table satisfying these
requirements.

```ruby
class CreatePets < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
  def change
    create_table :pets do |t|
      t.string :name, null: false
      t.string :breed

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

## Explain the Role of Seed Data

In your own words, explain the role of application seed data.

```md
The role of seed data is to allow developers working in development and test environments to quickly fill up a datbase once it has been created. This is useful because it is often necessary for developers to test more advanced functionality of their apps, but they might not necessarily want to use the real client data for various reasons.
```

Should seed data be used for experimentation during development?

```md
Yes, in fact this is perhaps its main purpose.
```
